I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed, my family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix’s ashes are divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time
Disappear into the night
Lost shadows left behind
Obsessions pulling me
Feeling I’ve got to take what’s mine
